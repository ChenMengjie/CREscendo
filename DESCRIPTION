Title: CREscendo: Identifying cell-type specific activities of cis-regulatory elements from scATAC-seq data
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Mengjie Chen

Description: CREscendo is designed to analyze differential usage of CREs by examining differences in Tn5 cleavage frequencies across cell types. This approach helps to recover regulatory signals that peak-based analyses often overlook.
